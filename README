This is my first try at creating a layer for building
the neutrino-mp set-top-box software.

Some stuff in here has been copied over from meta-magpie
(git://github.com/project-magpie/meta-magpie.git)

Right now, the master branch is supposed to work with
yocto release dizzy.

It is not yet finished and some hacks in it need improvement.
There's probably also some stuff in there which should move into
other layers or be pushed back upstream into the board BSPs,
especially everything recipes-raspi and recipes-local.
This is on my TODO list :-)

Anyway, have a lot of fun...
